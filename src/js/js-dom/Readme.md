# JavaScript DOM Practice

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating various aspects of JavaScript DOM manipulation. Each HTML file focuses on a specific concept to help deepen your understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model.

## Contents

1. **Event Delegation (event-delegation.html)**

   - Demonstrates efficient event handling using a single event listener on a parent element.
   - Shows how to manage events for dynamically added elements.

2. **Instance in JS (instance-in-js.html)**

   - Illustrates the creation and use of object instances in JavaScript.
   - Demonstrates how to create and interact with object instances dynamically.

3. **Observer Pattern (observer-pattern.html)**

   - Implements the Observer design pattern in JavaScript.
   - Shows how to create a simple stock price observer system.

4. **Race Condition (race-condition.html)**

   - Demonstrates potential race conditions in asynchronous JavaScript operations.
   - Illustrates how to identify and mitigate race conditions.

5. **DOM Traversal (dom-traversal.html)**

   - Explores various methods for navigating the DOM tree.
   - Demonstrates how to select, modify, and manipulate DOM elements.

6. **Event Bubbling and Capturing (event-bubbling-capturing.html)**

   - Illustrates the concepts of event bubbling and capturing in the DOM.
   - Shows how to control event propagation using JavaScript.

7. **DOM Manipulation (dom-manipulation.html)**

   - Demonstrates techniques for dynamically creating, modifying, and removing DOM elements.
   - Includes examples of innerHTML, createElement, and other DOM manipulation methods.

8. **Local Storage (local-storage.html)**
   - Explores using the browser's local storage for client-side data persistence.
   - Demonstrates how to store, retrieve, and clear data using localStorage.

## How to Practice

To run and experiment with these examples:

1. Copy the code from the desired HTML file.
2. Visit [OneCompiler HTML Editor](https://onecompiler.com/html).
3. Paste the code into the editor.
4. Click "Run" to see the results.
5. Modify the code to experiment and deepen your understanding.

This online compiler allows you to quickly test and visualize the DOM manipulation without needing to set up a local development environment.

Remember to open the browser's console (usually F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) to see any logged output or errors.

Happy coding and exploring the JavaScript DOM!
