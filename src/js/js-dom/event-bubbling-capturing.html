      const outer = document.getElementById("outer");
      const middle = document.getElementById("middle");
      const inner = document.getElementById("inner");

      // Add event listeners for both capturing and bubbling phases
      [outer, middle, inner].forEach((element) => {
        element.addEventListener("click", logEvent, true); // Capturing phase

        Event Bubbling and Capturing Explanation:

        1. Event Propagation:
           - When an event occurs on an element, it doesn't just trigger on that element.
           - The event "propagates" through the DOM tree in two phases: capturing and bubbling.

        2. Capturing Phase (top-down):
           - The event starts from the root (window) and moves down to the target element.
           - Listeners with the 'capture' flag set to true are triggered in this phase.

        3. Target Phase:
           - The event reaches the target element.

        4. Bubbling Phase (bottom-up):
           - After reaching the target, the event "bubbles up" back to the root.
           - Most event listeners are triggered during this phase by default.

        5. addEventListener() method:
           - Third parameter: 
             - true: listener is triggered during capturing phase
             - false (default): listener is triggered during bubbling phase

        6. event.eventPhase property:
           - 1: Capturing phase
           - 2: Target phase
           - 3: Bubbling phase

        7. Stopping Propagation:
           - event.stopPropagation(): Stops the event from moving to the next element
           - event.stopImmediatePropagation(): Stops the event and prevents other listeners on the same element

        8. Use Cases:
           - Capturing: Intercepting events before they reach deeper elements
           - Bubbling: Efficient event handling for multiple child elements (event delegation)

        This example demonstrates both phases by attaching listeners to nested divs.
        When clicking the inner div, you'll see events triggered in this order:
        1. Outer (capturing)
        2. Middle (capturing)
        3. Inner (capturing)
        4. Inner (bubbling)
        5. Middle (bubbling)
        6. Outer (bubbling)

        This showcases the complete journey of an event through the DOM tree.
